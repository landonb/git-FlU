# *** A Git command wrapper to provide a few enhancements.

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# USAGE:
#
# - Source this file from your ~/.bashrc.
#
#   It'll alias `git` to the function below.
#
# - Read on to learn what it does.

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# This wrapper double-checks with the user on destructive commands,
# e.g., when they're about to clobber unstaged and untracked files.
#
# This applies to commands like
#
#   `git co -- {}` and `git reset --hard {}`
#
# (and for which `git reflog` won't save you).
#
# - Basically, this wrapper prompts the user to continue if any of
#   these commands are called:
#
#       git co -- {}
#       git co .
#       git reset --hard {}
#
#   - In some cases, you can recover from `git reset` by looking in the
#     reflog and just checking out the branch identified before the reset.
#     But not if `--hard` is specified, in which case you might lose
#     unstaged changes and/or untracked files.

# HISTORY/2017-06-06: We all make mistakes sometimes, so I 
# like to make destructive commands less easily destructive.
#
# - E.g., I alias the `rm` command in my environment to `rm_safe`
#  (from https://github.com/landonb/sh-rm_safe), which "removes"
#  file objects to the ~/.trash directory (that you can remove
#  for real later with the `rmtrash` command).
#
# - Likewise, Git has a few destructive commands that I wanted to
#   make less easily destructive.
#
#   - For instance, when I first started using Git, I'd sometimes type
#
#       git co -- blurgh
#
#     when I meant to type instead
#
#       git reset HEAD blurgh
#
#     So I decided to add a prompt before running the clobbery checkout command.

# NOTE: The name of this function appears in the terminal window title, e.g., on
#       `git log`, the tmux window title might be, `_git_safe log | {tmux-title}`.
