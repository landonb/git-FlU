# This pre-push hook stops the push if lint blathers or if jest fails.

# USAGE: Place at .git/hooks/pre-push
#          and ensure executable
#        (or add a symlink to this file in git-smart).

# ***

# LEARN: Find more on hooks:
#
#          man 5 githooks

# ***

# SHARE: Modern Git lets us publish hooks in the repo without needing
#        each developer to place them under .git/hooks after checkout.
#        Instead, set config indicating where they live, e.g., if the
#        hooks are stored under .githooks/ then call:
#
#               git config core.hooksPath .githooks
#
#        - Alternatively, make a task in your build tooling.
#
#          You could use the following in, e.g., package.json or Makefile:
#
#            - Modern Git:
#
#               git config core.hooksPath .githooks
#
#            - Older <2.9:
#
#               find .git/hooks -type l -exec rm {} \;
#               find .githooks -type f -exec ln -sf ../../{} .git/hooks/ \;

# First, get the command arguments to check if --delete
# option was specified, in which case do not run checks.
# - We need this because Git passes, e.g., $1=remote and $2=remote-url,
#   but does not indicate branch names, or whether --delete specified.
PUSH_COMMAND="$(ps -ocommand= -p ${PPID})"

# This regex checks for -d/--delete option,
# including the old school :delete variant.
WILL_DELETE_BRANCH='( \-d| \-\-delete| :)'

ALLOW_FULL_FORCE_PUSH='( \-\-force)'

# Run checks, and return nonzero if errors observed.
# - Use -z to fail on not only ESLint errors, but also warnings (on any output).
# - Use --bail to fail Jest on first failed test rather than wasting Dev's time.
# - Note that Bash uses the result of the command (because it's the last one in
#   this file) as the script's return value (aka the exit code; or $?).
